            <h4>US Healthcare and the party line</h4>
            <br>
            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p>On December 4, 2009, the Senate Democrats passed with a simple majority, HR 3590, 
            the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), 61-39. Republicans opposed the bill. 
            On March 21, 2010, the 111th Congress House of Representatives passed the bill (219 -212). 
            The bill had 34 Democrats who opposed the bill.  Fast forward, on May 4, 2017, the 115th Congress 
            voted to repeal and replace the ACA. The Republican party created their healthcare insurance bill, 
            HR 1628, The American Health Care Act (AHCA). The bill passed in the House along party lines 
            (217-213) but with 20 Republicans joining the Democrats and 1 not voting. The Senate bill vote was 
            to partially repeal the ACA. It failed in the Senate (51-49) so the ACA was saved.
            </p>
            <p>Health Insurance is universal in many countries, but not in the United States. It has been a 
              critical talking point for many years. The purpose of the ACA was to provide affordable health 
              insurance to those whose income fell between a certain % of the federal poverty line and expand 
              the Medicaid program based on income that fell at a certain % of the federal poverty line. States 
              have the option to opt-in, but not all have expanded their Medicaid program. Is Health Insurance 
              a right or a privilege? Should the government provide health insurance for all its citizens? We 
              have heard countries around the world who provide such a benefit to their citizens. Democrats view
               health insurance as a right for all Americans, while Republicans (those who want to repeal ACA) 
               see it as an overreach, not something that the government should do, as well as make deep cuts to
                Medicaid. The deep cuts to Medicaid is another talking point that has come time and time again 
                much longer than the ACA issue.
            </p>
            <p><i>
              There is broad consensus that an estimated 20 million to 22 million 
              individuals have obtained healthcare insurance since 2010 primarily through the expansion of 
              Medicaid, coverage through parents’ policies for young adults until age 26 years, and the 
              healthcare exchanges. But that leaves more than 25 million US residents without health insurance. 
              Is the United States a just and fair society if so many individuals lack health care coverage? 
              The United States guarantees all citizens an education, access to fire and police services, a 
              national postal service, protection by the military, a national park system, and many other 
              federal- and state-funded services. But the country has not yet committed to ensuring that all of 
              its citizens have health care coverage.</i></p>

            <h6>Goal</h6>
            <p>I am using Curved with half-arrow. This is the best symbol for providing
          direction of the flow and is easily readable. Both the color and thickness are proportional to 
          the level of flow so that if it is not clear in the thickness the color will allude to the amount 
          of flow based on the legend, the lighter the color, the lighter the flow, and the darker the 
          color the heavier the flow. The black stroke color allows the arrow/flow lines to pop-out 
          from the background and provide clarity. The FlowMapper application allows me to adjust 
          the thickness of the line based on a min/max setting, making this an unclassed map. The 
          ability to adjust the line thickness will make it easier to adjust accordingly where there may 
          be overlapping flows. The map shows the top 18 flows. The color of the flows does not make 
          it difficult to see each distinctive flow.
            </p>
            <h6>Node Symbol:</h6> 
            <p>Is placed at the centroid of the regions being analyzed. I chose the node 
          symbol color to be black to stand out and show as a strong indicator for the center of each 
          country. It stands beautifully against the choropleth colors. If there are competing lines, the 
          centroid stands out and can direct the viewer to the start or end point of a flow location. 
          The nodes also have varying sizes based on the min/max of the data. This setting can be 
          adjusted using the Flower Mapper application based on a min/max setting. The varying sizes 
          are proportional to the Total Flow of the country.
            </p>
            <h6>Choropleth map:</h6> 
            <p>The choropleth map colors that I chose pink/yellow/green. These colors 
          represent a diverging color scheme. The dark and light pink colors represent a negative net 
          flow, where there are higher exports and lower imports of bananas for a country in tons. The 
          light and dark green colors represent higher imports and lower exports of bananas for a 
          country in tons. The dividing line is 0 with a neutral color. The stroke line is black and the 
          width is .5 so that it is easy to see each country’s boundary.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Interpretation of flow patterns</h4>
            <br>
            <p>The places that have the most flows – Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. The map shows
          these 3 countries have the largest nodes with green colors, indicating the highest 
          amount of imports and the flow symbol to these countries has red and orange flow
          patterns indicating heavy flows.
            </p>
            <p>The places that send the most flows – Ecuador, Bolivia, and Brazil. These 3 countries 
          have the largest nodes with pink colors, indicating the countries with the largest 
          exports. Also, the red and orange flows are coming from these countries.
            </p>
            <p> The general direction of flows (e.g., north-south, east-west, etc.) with context to the geography 
          of the flow data set is North to South. Based on the readings, the northern part of the continent is more 
          conducive to growing bananas, unlike the southern part.
            </p>
            <p>The flow pattern is based on the relation to location characteristics displayed by node symbol and choropleth 
          base map. Based on the choropleth map colors and direction of flow, the countries in the north 
          are pink and show the largest flow amount. They have a negative net flow which 
          indicates that they export more to the lower southern regions who import more and 
          have a green country color
