                with the highest population percentage 25 plus with a Bachelors (dark purple) are located in the central and the eastern area of the county.
                This aligns with the makeup of the county where we find the higher incomes and homes are located. The rest of the county shows more variablity, 
                with a mix of low to high. The city which is located at the western part of the county ranges from low to medium with a Bachelors
                (showing in the lightest purple to med purple).

                concludes as expected, the higher median incomes is in the suburbs that is is located in the east side of the county, while the lower

                   percentage is 25+ with a BA (high)/Median Income (low). The dark maroon color at the top of the legend is 
                   where both attributes are at their highest. We see this in the suburbs (far east) and close to the center 
                   bottom of the map. This is where the county has its more affluent households. This group has a high percentage 
                   of the population 25+ with a bachelor's degree and the highest Household Median Income. The center color of the 
                   legend is a mix of both attributes that fall in the medium of the data values. This is scattered throughout the 
                   county. Lastly, the remaining 4 colors in the legend is a mix of both attribute combinations (low, med, high). 
                   Those colors with a saturation closer to blue indicate Household Median Income is high and % population 25+ with 
                   a BA is low or medium and those that are more saturated with red indicate that the % population 25+ with BA is high 
                   and the Household Median Income is low or medium.</p>

                a climate that is condusive to growing bananas unlike the southern countries, hence the direction of flow. The black circle
                in the center of each country are nodes. The size is proportional to the total flow in each country (imports + exports).
